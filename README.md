# Framework for Mining Arguments

Welcome to the Framework for Mining Arguments repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for mining arguments from textual data. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, along with machine learning and deep learning algorithms, users can automatically train and generate models that mine arguments for further analysis. This capability enables deeper insights and facilitates comprehensive analysis for a wide range of applications.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of argumentation mining, this repository offers a powerful toolkit to explore and advance the understanding of complex textual arguments.

## Get Started

Execute the following commands in your terminal (such as PowerShell) to condition the environment to run the argument mining framework:

```console
cd /arg-min-fw
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the argument mining framework execute the following command in the terminal:

```console
python ./src/app/main.py
```

Deactivate the virtual environment when done:

```console
deactivate
```
